    <h1>Objectives</h1>

    <h2>Modularity</h2>
    
    <img align="right" src="moduledesign.gif" border="0" />
    <p>&ExTeX;'s object-oriented design (see figure) includes some main
    modules that act without knowledge about the functioning of the
    other modules (encapsulation). Thus the frontend with tokenisation
    and the expansion of tokens, up to the creation of nodes are
    exchangeable, independently from the typesetter. The same applies
    to the backend that generates the output. A special role plays the
    font module that provides font information to the typesetter as
    well as to the output module.</p>

    <p>Inside the main modules other subdivisons are established, making
    subtitution or enhancement of single aspects of a function
    possible. So the font module may be extended to new formats by
    adding or replacing a font reader, without directly affecting
    other parts of the program. Likewise new algorithms may be
    integrated into the typesetter that is responsible for line
    breaking and the structure of the page. </p>

    <h2>Compatibility</h2>

    <p>&ExTeX; will provide all of &TeX;'s primitives. Since syntax
    and function of some primitives (e.g. <tt>\input</tt>) leads to
    undesirable constraints on modern systems, supplemental primitives
    will be designed and implemented in these cases. The old variants
    will clearly be marked obsolete. In some cases this has been done
    already. Hardly understandable peculiarities of &TeX; can be
    abandoned in favour of a clean implementation. Moreover the
    behaviour in case of an error will not be emulated completely
    equally. Eventually &ExTeX; shall be able to typeset existing
    documents visually identically to &TeX;.</p>

    <p>&ExTeX; will not be compatible regarding the strict separation of
    ini&TeX; and vir&TeX;. So far, loading of hyphenation patterns and
    creation of format files is possible only for ini&TeX;. &ExTeX; on the
    other hand shall be able to load hyphenation patterns globally at
    any time, i.e. it shall not be limited to hyphenation tables that
    are stored in the format files. Therefore it will be possible to
    load only those hyphenation tables at runtime that are actually
    needed. &ExTeX; also has the ablility to create a format under
    particular conditions, namely outside of any group.</p>

    <p>From &epsilon;-&TeX; mainly those facilities will be adopted whose
    main effect is not limited to the logging messages. The additional
    tracing primitives are not adopted to the vocabulary of &ExTeX;
    because &ExTeX; will provide its own progressive facilities for
    debugging purposes. The facilities of &epsilon;-&TeX; to toggle the
    direction of writing will be omitted, too. These can be realised
    with the help of &Omega;-compatible primitives on macro level.
    Thus compatibility to real existing &epsilon;-&TeX; documents should
    be obtained.</p>

    <p>From &Omega; the extensions regarding the fonts will be taken, as
    well as the feature of setting the direction of writing. However
    &ExTeX; will not adopt the encoding functions of &Omega;, but
    instead realise 16-bit capability with its own easily
    comprehensible methodes. Here established basic facilities of Java
    will be used.</p>

    <p>There are two kinds of pdf&TeX; features: those controlling PDF
    output, and those providing additional typographic features. The
    latter shall be widely adopted. Here the problem arises that in
    pdf&TeX; these primitives are prefixed with »pdf«, too. Hence new
    names and partially other primitives will replace them in &ExTeX;.
    As above, macros may be used as the connective link. In most
    cases, e.g. with &LaTeX; packages like graphics or hyperref, a
    change to a new driver is recommended. This all the more, as the
    way to implement capabilities that are strongly depenent on the
    backend is different in&ExTeX;.</p>

    <h2>New Features</h2>

    <p>Although &ExTeX; is designed so that new facilities can easily
    be added to every main module &ndash; actually on the level of
    primitives &ndash; &ExTeX; will right from start be equipped with
    some innovations. One of these is the handling of different
    encodings of input files. At this &ExTeX; uses Java's built-in
    facilities to transfer read characters into an internal 32-bit
    coding.</p>

    <p>As several of &TeX;'s primitives are limited to 8-bit, and &Omega;
    to 16-bit, new appropriate equivalents will be defined, e.g. for
    <tt>\mathcode</tt>. On the other hand, \char will be able to
    handle values greater than 255 directly. Actually this is an
    incompatibility to &TeX;, but since &TeX; would report an error in
    this case, this behaviour is compatible to existing error-free
    documents.</p>

    <p>Expansions that do not depend on a specific output format, but
    are &ndash; even in various ways &ndash; supported by different
    output formats, will have their own primitives. Examples for this
    are the begin and end of links as well as their targets./

    <p>&TeX; knows elements that do not deal with typography of the
    page, but they must be processed when it is written out
    (<tt>\shipout</tt>). Examples for this whatsits are
    <tt>\openout</tt>, <tt>\closeout</tt> and <tt>\write</tt>, always
    without being prefixed with <tt>\immediate</tt>. Especially these
    should not have any effect on page breaking, which can't be
    guaranteed by &TeX; as is. This deficency shall be improved in
    &ExTeX;, despite arising incompatibilities.</p>

    <p>Among the whatsits, the <tt>\special</tt> primitive plays a
    special role. Depending on its meaning, it may have effects on
    line or page breaking (e.g. if a graphic is inserted), or not
    (e.g. if colour is changed). Apart from the fact that &ExTeX; will
    support colours directly, &ExTeX; will have a new primitive for
    extensions that depend on the output format. When encountering
    this primitive, the typesetter will demand the decision whether
    the element affects line or page breaking from the backend (see
    IObject and Boxsize in the figure). For example, a PDF backend may
    return the size of an image that was inserted by this
    primitive.</p>

    <p>Medium-term &ExTeX; shall provide graphical elements like lines
    of arbitrary gradient, ellipses, bezier curves etc. Also graphical
    transformations like rotation, reflexion, or scaling shall be
    implemented.</p>
