    <h1>Open Issues</h1>

    <p>A large part of what is to be programmed in ExTeX> shall
      provide the same functionality as TeX does. The way to go is
      determined by and large, but not always easy because it's
      desired to get a structure as modular as possible. The
      extensions offered by &epsilon;-TeX will probably be realised
      similarly to the already implemented primitives and operators of
      TeX. However the following (so far only suggested) extensions
      and modifications are different. They require a more intense
      analysis of the matter. Hence they would be suitable for
      diplomas or thesis:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	Typesetting of paragraphs that differ from the usual
	rectangular shape. We look for a general solution that
	provides more than what is offered by the <tt>\parshape</tt>
	primitive. A lot of difficulties arise if multiple attempts of
	breaking these paragraphs are considered, as well as breaking
	of pages.
      </li>
      <li>
	Fonts management. The way TeX currently deals with fonts has
	many limitations which makes it very awkward. The internal use
	of 32-bit encoded characters in ExTeX aggravates the problem.
	The following briefly mentioned problems are related to that:
	<ul>
	  <li>micro adjustment of kerning and letter size </li>
	  <li>protruding characters</li>
	  <li>letterspacing and the like</li>
	  <li>right-to-left typesetting</li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	The possibility to optimise line and page breaking across
	several pages. It would be desirable to have alternative page
	breaks of certain pages calculated within a single ExTeX run,
	and to have improper results rejected. Apart from technical
	questions about this kind of optimisation a basic strategy is
	widely unknown. This is connected with the possibility to
	typeset only single pages or even parts of it, instead of a
	complete document. This would help to build a WYSIWYG TeX.
      </li>
      <li>
	So-called &ldquo;backing up&rdquo; of boxes of a page.  This
	means that lines of text may be positioned only at specific
	vertical locations of the page, so that adjacent pages harmonise
	better with each other.  Considering that a page does not only
	contain text lines of equal size, but also graphics,
	mathematical formulae etc, a solution is expected to be not
	trivial.
      </li>
    </ol>
