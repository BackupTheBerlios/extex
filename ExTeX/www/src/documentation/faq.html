    <dt>Under which License is &ExTeX; distributed?</dt>
    <dd>The core part of &ExTeX; is distributed under the

    </dd>

    <dt>How is &ExTeX; pronounced?</dt>
    <dd>The first sylable is pronounced ex as in expandable. And you

  }}</pre>
    </dd>

    <dt>Which version of Java is required for &ExTeX;?</dt>
    <dd>&ExTeX; requires Java in version 1.4.2 or newer. Older versions
    may suffice but nobody has tries it.
    </dd>

    <dt>Does &ExTeX; run under a "free" Java?</dt>
    <dd>&ExTeX; is developed with the Sun JDK and the Eclipse system.
     The last time we checked &ExTeX; did not compile with GCJ.
