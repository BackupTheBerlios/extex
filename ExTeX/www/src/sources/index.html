   <h1>Prerequisites</h1>

   &ExTeX; is implemented in Java. Thus a Java runtime environment at
   least in version 1.4.0 is required. Java can be downloaded from <a
   href="http://java.sun.com">java.sun.com</a>. All other required
   libraries are part of the &ExTeX; distribution.

   <h1>Sources</h1>

   <p>The sources are currently available via CVS. See 
   <a href="repository.html">[Repository]</a> for details.</p>

   <p>The sources are also contained in the installer. They can be
   retrieved as package Source during the installation.
   </p>

   <h1>Stable Release</h1> 

   No binaries of the release 0.1 are available yet.

   <h1>Snapshot</h1> 

   <p>
     Snapshots of the development are provided on a daily basis.
     These snapshots may not serve any purpose and may not even be complete.
     The snapshot is distributed in one file
     <a href="&top;snapshot/ExTeX-setup.jar">ExTeX-setup.jar</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
     To install the snapshot run Java on the the file ExTeX-setup.jar. Depending on
     your operating system and your installation this can be achieved by
     double-clicking the file or by running the following command
     <pre>
       java -jar ExTeX-setup.jar  </pre>
   </p>
   <p>
     The setup program is a graphical installer. Thus a graphical system
     is essential. Details of the installation and its steps can be found
     in the <a href="&top;documentation/man/extex-users.pdf">User's Guide</a>.
