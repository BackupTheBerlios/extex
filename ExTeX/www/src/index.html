   <h1>&ExTeX;</h1> 

   In December 2002 a small group of experts and developers came
   together to initiate the development of a new derivate of &TeX;,
   based on NTS. Initially there were a few ideas and the necessity to
   familiarise with existing sources and &TeX; extensions. After a lot
   of experiments and examinations, and yet before the group's first
   closed meeting from October 3<sup>rd</sup> to 5<sup>th</sup> 2003,
   it was clear that the ambitious goals could be achieved only if
   large parts of &TeX; &ndash; and with it NTS &ndash; were replaced.
   This led to the decision to develop a new Java-based system, using
   the experiences of NTS, &epsilon;-&TeX;, pdf&TeX;, and &Omega;
   (Omega): &ExTeX;.

   <h1>Your Help is Welcome</h1> 

   <p>
   During intensively discussions of the &ExTeX; team about own and
   potential expectations about a new typesetting program, it became
   obvious that we could not completely evaluate all aspects. In
   several fields we were simply lacking necessary competence.
   Moreover there are more or less urgent wishes, expecially from
   format and package developers, we did not think of at all so far.
   </p>
   <p>
   We hope this page will help to get into discussions with people to
   tell us their wishes. It would be helpful however that important
   problems or ideas would be sent to us as soon as possible.
   </p>
   <p>
   There are many fields where new concepts have to be developed. Here
   and on the plain implementation, support of any kind is welcome.
