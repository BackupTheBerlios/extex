<h1>Road Map</h1>

<p>
 The releases of &ExTeX; will be driven by features contained.
 The list below shows some of the short term features to be
 provided
</p>
<p>
 Since the development of &ExTeX; is a spare-time activity of the
 &ExTeX; team no dates can be comfirmed for the releases.
</p>

<h2>Feature &TeX;</h2>
<p>
 The release is feature complete for the &TeX; compatibility mode.
 This means that all primitives of &TeX; are present and functional.
 The typesetting can produce a dvi file which is equivalent &ndash; but
 not necessarily identical &ndash; to the file produced by &TeX;
</p>
