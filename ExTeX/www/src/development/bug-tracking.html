<h1>Bug Tracking</h1>

<p>
 If you encounter any bug in &ExTeX; please report them to the &ExTeX;
 team. The bug report should contain a minimal example demonstrating
 the problem and a description in which way the expected result differs
 from the result encountered. In addition you should enclose the
 relevant information about your environment. This should include:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>the operating system including its version</li>
 <li>the version of the Java runtime used (use <tt>java -version</tt>)</li>
 <li>the minimal input file</li>
 <li>the invocation of &ExTeX; (command line) with all parameters</li>
 <li>the log file produced</li>
</ul>

<p>
 The bug report can be filed directly at the bug tracker of &ExTeX;:
 <ul>
  <li><a href="https://developer.berlios.de/bugs/?group_id=1915">Bug
   Tracker</a></li>
 </ul>
 There you can also see the old bugs reported. Please try to make sure
 that your bug has not been reported before.
</p>

<p>
 You can also report a bug via email to
 <a href="mailto:extex-bugs@lists.berlios.de">extex-bugs@lists.berlios.de</a>. 
 Here the same rules apply.
