   <h1>&TeX; and Successors</h1>

   <h2>&TeX;</h2>

   In 1982 <a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/">Donald
   E. Knuth</a> has released &TeX;. &TeX; is a typesetting system
   which shows an excellent quality of the produced results.

   <h2>TeX-XeT</h2>

   Donald E. Knuth and Pierre MacKay have written an extension of
   &TeX; which is able to include left-to-right material as well as
   right-to-left material. Is is accomlished with the help of an
   extended DVI format which can be translated to plain DVI
   afterwards. This development has been superceeded by TeX--XeT and
   &eTeX;.

   <h2>TeX--XeT</h2>

   Peter Breitenlohner has reimplemented TeX-XeT system releasing it
   from the need to use an extended DVI format. The development has
   been integrated into &eTeX;.

   <h2>&eTeX;</h2> 

   In 1996 some extensions have been released which where built into
   the Web sources of &TeX; mainly by Peter Breitenlohner. The main
   extensions where concerned with bidirectional typesetting and
   better debugging support.

   <h2>pdf&TeX;</h2> 

   In 1997 Han The Thanh has created a derived system based on the
   original &TeX; system. The main extensions are centered around
   improved typesetting and generating of PDF as direct output format.
   The development is continued by the PDF group.

   <h2>&Omega; (Omega)</h2>

   John Plaice and Yannis Haralambous have released another version of
   a typesetting system based on &TeX;. The major focus has been laid
   on the extension of &TeX; to use 16-bit fonts and bidirectional
   typesetting. In addition to these extensions some limitations of
   &TeX; have been raised and a powerful preprocessing has been added.

   <h2>NTS</h2> 

   In 1998 a Java-based successor for &TeX; has been initiated. The
   programmer Karel Skoupy has released the sources of <a
   href="http://nts.tug.org/">NTS</a> in 2001. The further development
   seens to be frozen.
