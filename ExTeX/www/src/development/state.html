    <a name="main"></a><h2>Main Control</h2>
    <p>
     The components of &ExTeX; are tied together by a main program.
     Currently a &TeX;-compatible command line main program is
     provided with &ExTeX;. This main program is pretty complete.
     Other main programs can be envisaged in the future.
    </p>
    <a name="extex"></a><h2>ExTeX Instance</h2>
    <p>
     The &ExTeX; instance ties together the core funtionality. It
     abstracts from any user interaction. This central component is
     fully functional.
    </p>
    <a name="input-subsystem"></a><h2>Input Subsystem</h2>
    <p>
     The input subsystem is responsible for reading from an input
     stream and tokenizes it.
    </p>
    <a name="inputfilter"></a><h3>Input Filter</h3>
    <p>
     Input filters can be used to preprocess the input stream before
     it is seen by the scanner. Currently no input filters are
     provided.
    </p>
    <a name="scanner"></a><h3>Scanner</h3>
    <p>
     Two implementations for the scanner are
     fully functional. They provide a TeX-compatible and an extended
     functionality. 
    </p>
    <a name="interpreter-subsystem"></a><h2>Interpreter Subsystem</h2>
    <p>
     The interpreter subsystem provides a &TeX;-compatible macro
     processor. This is based on a context which contains the state of
     the whole engine &ndash; like the eqtable of &TeX;.
    </p>
    <a name="interpreter"></a><h2>Interpreter</h2>
    <p>
     The interpreter is nearly complete. Registers, conditionals,
     macros, file IO &ndash; including a configurable <tt>\write18</tt> &ndash;
     are in place. Some functionality is not complete &ndash; like the
     outer flag for macros.
    </p>
    <a name="context"></a><h2>Interpreter Context</h2>
    <p>
     There are two implementation of the context. One with the
     &TeX;-compatible set of registers and one with additional registers
     &ndash; like real numbers. Those contexts are pretty stable. Only
     the observability &nbsp; for tracing and debugging &nbsp; needs
     to be completed.
    </p>
    <p>
     All primitives of &TeX; are present but not fully functional.
     Especially the primitives related to math typesetting and table
     typesetting need further attention. Some extensions from &eTeX;,
     &pdfTeX;, and &Omega;  have already been implemented.
    </p>
    <a name="backend"></a><h2>Backend</h2>
    <p>
     The backend contains all components which process the page after
     the typesetting is complete. Usually this processing involves the
     translation of the nodes into some external format. Optionally
     some processing can be performed on the nodes before they are
     translated and on the byte stream after the translation.
    </p>
    <a name="documentwriter"></a><h3>Document Writer</h3>
    <p>
     The document writer defines the translation of nodes into a
     native output format. Several implementations are provided.
    </p>
    <a name="dvi"></a><h3>DVI Writer</h3>
    <p>
     The DVI format is the original output format of &TeX;. &ExTeX;
     comes with two implementations to produce DVI. One is just for
     plain DVI and one includes support for dvips specials. Both are
     pretty complete.
    </p>
    <a name="pdf"></a><h3>PDF Writer</h3>
    <p>
     The first draft of a translation into PDF is present.
    </p>
    <a name="ps"></a><h3>PS Writer</h3>
    <p>
     A translation into PostScript format is present. The embedding of
     fonts is missing.
    </p>
    <a name="eps"></a><h3>EPS Writer</h3>
    <p>
     A translation into encapsulated PostScript format is present. The
     embedding of fonts is missing.
    </p>
    <a name="svg"></a><h3>SVG Writer</h3>
    <p>
     The SVG writer produces SVG files.
    </p>
    <a name="nodepipe"></a><h3>Node Pipe</h3>
    <p>
     The node pipe processes the nodes before they are translated to a
     native format.
    </p>
    <a name="outputfilter"></a><h3>Output Filter</h3>
    <p>
     The concept of an ouput filter completes the chain of processing
     by manipulation on the level of the output format. This component
     is not implemented at all.
    </p>
    <a name="typesetting"></a><h2>Typesetting Subsystem</h2>
    <p>
     The typesetting subsystem is responsible of taking a stream of
     nodes and producing pages. In the course of this action several
     tasks have to be performed: hyphenation, ligature insertion,
     paragraph breaking, and page breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     The interfaces for the componets are defined. The implementation
     of several components has to be completed.
    </p>
    <a name="typesetter"></a><h3>Typesetter</h3>
    <p>
     The typesetter ties togeter the sub-components. It is fully
     functional.
    </p>
    <a name="pagebuilder"></a><h3>Page Builder</h3>
    <p>
     The page builder splits material off the main vertical list and
     ships it out as pages. A basic implementation id present. Further
     implementations have to be provided.
    </p>
    <a name="paragraphbuilder"></a><h3>Paragraph Builder</h3>
    <p>
     The paragraph builder splits paragraphs into lines and aligns
     them properly. Several implementations are provided. One of them
     is a &TeX;-compatible reimplementation.
    </p>
    <a name="ligaturebuilder"></a><h3>Ligature Builder</h3>
    <p>
     The ligature builder inserts ligatures into the paragraph at hand.
    </p>
    <a name="hyphenation"></a><h3>Hypenation</h3>
     The hyphenation component encapsulates language specific
     processing of the paragraph at hand. The insertion of soft
     hyphenations and splitting off words are the major tasks. One
     &TeX;-compatible implementation is present; Other implementations
     with enhanced functionality can be envisioned.
    <p>
    </p>
    <a name="fontsubsystem"></a><h2>Font Subsystem</h2>
    <p>
     The task of the font subsystem is to provide the information
     about the glyphs in a font. Various types of fonts should be
     supported. Type-1 fonts and tfm fonts can already be processed.
     Other types like vf fonts have to be completed or completely
     implemented. 
    </p>
    <a name="font"></a><h3>Font</h3>
    <p>
     Font is the generic interface to handle different kinds of fonts
     in &ExTeX;. A first implementation is present. A massive
     refactoring towards full support of Unicode fonts is under way.
    </p>
    <a name="efm"></a><h3>ExTeX Font Metrics</h3>
    <p>
     EFM provides a means to store the internal representation of a
     font for fast loading. This feaure is functional for the first
     generation of fonts.
    </p>
    <a name="tfm"></a><h3>TeX Font Metrics</h3>
    <p>
     TFM files as defined by &TeX; can be read and used.
    </p>
    <a name="afm"></a><h3>Adobe Font Metrics</h3>
    <p>
     AFM files can be read. A massive
     refactoring towards full support of Unicode fonts is under way.
    </p>
    <a name="ttf"></a><h3>TrueType Fonts</h3>
    <p>
     Truetype fonts can be read. A massive
     refactoring towards full support of Unicode fonts is under way.
    </p>
    <a name="vf"></a><h3>Virtual Fonts</h3>
    <p>
     Virtal fonts can be read and used.
    </p>
    <a name="pfb"></a><h3>PFB</h3>
    <p>
     PFB files can be read. A massive
     refactoring towards full support of Unicode fonts is under way.
    </p>
    <a name="otf"></a><h3>OpenType Fonts</h3>
    <p>
     Work on OpenType fonts has been started.
    </p>
    <a name="fontfamily"></a><h3>Font Family</h3>
    <p>
     The concept of font families is known from macro packages like
     &LaTeX; on the other side target output formats like RTF use font
     families as well. Thus &ExTeX; will be extended to support font
     families in addition to solitary fonts.
    </p>
    <a name="framework"></a><h2>Framework</h2>
    <p>
     The implementation of &ExTeX; is based on a component framework.
     This component framework provides means for managing the
     lifecycle of a component &ndash; especially the creation in
     factories. This includes services like configuration and logging.
     The framework is inspired by the Apache Avalon framework.
    </p>
    <p>
     The framework is pretty stable. The functionality needed is
     provided. This part can be considered complete.
    </p>
    <a name="localizer"></a><h3>Localizer</h3>
    <p>
     The localizer can be used to access resource bundles. It provides
     some convenience functionality for localizing, i.e. the
     translation of messages into other languages. The default
     language is English. This is fully functional. Some experiments
     with German have shown that the concept is vlaid and complete.
    </p>
    <a name="factory"></a><h3>Generic Factory</h3>
    <p>
     The generic facory provides support for all kinds of factories.
     It automaticaly takes care of several cross cutting concerns like
     logging and configuration. The generic factory is completed.
    </p>
    <a name="configuration"></a><h3>Configuration Support</h3>
    <p>
     The configuration support can be used to configure an
     application. Currently an implementation based on an XML
     configuration is provided. This is fully functional.
    </p>
    <a name="resourcefinder"></a><h3>Resource Finder</h3>
    <p>
     The start of processing consists of the finding of an input file.
     This applies to TeX documents, formats, fonts, etc. The task of
     finding files of different kinds is accomplished by file finders.
     The interface and infrastructure is in place. Several
     implementations of file finders are present. They can be selected
     and combined in the configuration.
    </p>
