    <h1>State of Implementation</h1>
    <p>
     The state of development is associated to the following component
     diagram of ExTeX.

    <a name="scanner"><h2>Input Subsystem</h2></a>
    <p>
     The input subsystem is responsible for reading from an input
     stream and tokenizes it. Two implementations for the scanner are
     fully functional. They provide a TeX-compatible and an extended
     functionality. 
    </p>
    <p>
     The concept of an input filter should provide a hook to
     preprocess the input before it is seen by the scanner. This
     component is currently a dummy.
    </p>

    <a name="interpreter"><h2>Interpreter Subsystem</h2></a>
    <p>
     The interpreter subsystem provides a TeX-compatible macro
     processor. This is based on a context which contains the state of
     the whole engine &ndash; like the eqtable of TeX.
    </p>
    <p>
     The interpreter is nearly complete. Registers, conditionals,
     macros, file IO &ndash; including a configurable \write18 &ndash;
     are in place. Some functionality is not complete &ndash; like the
     outer flag for macros.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are two implementation of the context. One with the
     TeX-compatible set of registers and one with additional registers
     &ndash; like real numbers. Those contexts are pretty stable. Onle
     the observability &nbsp; for tracing and debugging &nbsp; needs
     to be completed.
    </p>
    <p>
     All primitives of TeX are present but not fully functional.
     Especially the primitives related to math typesetting and table
     typesetting need further attention. Some extensions from &eTeX;
     have already been implemented.
    </p>

    <a name="typesetter"><h2>Typesetting Subsystem</h2></a>

    <p>
     The typesetting subsystem is responsible of taking a stream of
     nodes and producing pages. In the course of this action several
     tasks have to be performed: hyphenation, ligature insertion,
     paragraph breaking, and page breaking.
    </p>
    <p>
     The interfaces for the componets are defined. The implementation
     of several components has to be completed.
    </p>

    <a name="font"><h2>Font Subsystem</h2></a>

    <p>
     The task of the font subsystem is to provide the information
     about the glyphs in a font. Various types of fonts should be
     supported. Type-1 fonts and tfm fonts can already be processed.
     Other types like vf fonts have to be completed or completely
     implemented. 
    </p>

    <a name="backend"><h2>Backend Subsystem</h2></a>

    <p>
     The backend subsystem takes the pages produced by the typesetter
     and generates the appropriate output format. Several backend
     imlementations have been started. Amoung them is a PDF backend, a
     DVI backend, and a XML (SVG) backend.
    </p>
    <p>
     The different backends deserve further development.
    </p>
    <p>
     The concept of an ouput filter completes the chain of processing
     by manipulation on the level of the output format. This component
     is not implemented at all.
    </p>

    <a name="framework"><h2>Framework</h2></a>

    <p>
     The implementation of ExTeX is based on a component framework.
     This component framework provides means for managing the
     lifecycle of a component &ndash; especially the creation in
     factories. This includes services like configuration and logging.
     The framework is inspired by the Apache Avalon framework.
    </p>
    <p>
     The framework is pretty stable. The functionality needed is
     provided. This part can be considered complete.
    </p>

    <a name="minor"><h2>Minor components</h2></a>

    <p>
     There are several minor components in ExTeX. Some are described
     here. 
    </p>
    <a name="finder"></a>
    <p>
     The start of processing consists of the finding of an input file.
     This applies to TeX documents, formats, fonts, etc. The task of
     finding files of different kinds is accomplished by file finders.
     The interface and infrastructure is in place. Several
     implementations of file finders are present. They can be selected
     and combined in the configuration.
    </p>
    <a name="main"></a>
    <p>
     The components of ExTeX are tied together by a main program.
     Currently a TeX-compatible command line main program is
     provided with ExTeX. This main program is pretty complete.
     Other main programs can be envisaged in the future.
    </p>
