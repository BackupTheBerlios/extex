    <h1>State of Implementation</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<strong>Tokenizer:</strong>
	<p>
	  The tokenizer generates single tokens from various sources
	  (e.g. a file) and provides them in a stack.  The encoding of
	  each file is taken into account, which can also be
          set by a primitive.  All of Java's standard encodings are
	  supported (others may be defined in special cases).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Special or Unicode characters can be read in various ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li> Standard TeX variant:&nbsp;<tt>^^...</tt>	   </li>
	  <li>Unicode:&nbsp;<tt>^^^<em>Unicodename;</em></tt>	   </li>
	  <li>Omega variant:&nbsp;<tt>^^^^<em>Hex-number</em></tt> </li>
	</ul>
	<p>
	  The TokenizerStack may be shown optionally in a window (visual
	  debugger), in order to follow the progress and generation of
	  tokens.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Filemanager</strong>
	<p>
	  All files are loaded by a central FileManager.  All accesses
	  are cached.  The FileManager searches and loads files in
	  directories defined in <var>TEXINPUTS</var>, and
	  additionally in given JAR archives.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Newly created files are saved to the directory
	  <var>TEXOUTPUTS</var>, or to the current one. If it is not
	  writeable, the substitution directory <var>TEXMFOUTPUT</var>
	  is used instead.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>EqTable</strong>
	<p>
	  The EqTable takes all primitives, parameters etc. and stores
	  them in the appropriate group levels.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This table (the keys and their according values) may
	  optionally be shown in a special window (visual debugger), in
	  order to track values etc.  A filter is provided for setting
	  the visible range.  A breakpoint mechanism allows to stop the
	  processing if the value of an entry changes.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Log Output</strong>
	<p>
	  Output is generated according to the applied filter
	  (separately for terminal and logfile).  An appropriate output
	  encoding may be specified, too.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Registers</strong>
	<p>
	  Registers are not explicitly limited to a certain size.  It
	  only depends on the counter (a 32-bit integer is used) and the
	  available memory.
	</p>
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Primitives</strong>
	<p>
	  &hellip;&nbsp;are considered step-by-step.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
