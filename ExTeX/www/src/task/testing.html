   <h1>&ExTeX; Testing</h1> 

   <p>
   &TeX; is accompanied by the trip test. This test tries to ensure that
   any system named &TeX; works properly. This means that it is a
   regression test suite.
   </p>
   <p>
   &ExTeX; needs a regression test suite which should ensure
     <ul>
       <li>That &ExTeX; properly provides the functionality of &TeX;
         for backward compatibility.
       </li>
       <li>That the functionality of &ExTeX; stays intact across
         versions of ExTeX;
       </li>
     </ul>
   </p>
   <p>
   Some test cases and a framework for testing is already present in &ExTeX;.
   This is based on JUnit.
   </p>

   <h1>Wanted</h1> 

   Several persons are wanted to cover different aspects of this
   important and time consuming task:
   <ul>
     <li>Someone with skills in &TeX; is required to write a bunch of
       additional test cases.</li>
     <li>Someone with skills in Java and &TeX; to code the test cases
       in JUnit.
     </li>
     <li>Someone with skills in Java to regularily run the test cases
       and assign the problematic cases to maintainers of single pieces
       of code.
     </li>
     <li>Maybe someone with skills in Maven to automate the process.
     </li>
   </ul>
