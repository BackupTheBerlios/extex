   <h1>Documentation</h1> 

   <p>
   The end user of a program relies on the availability of proper
   documentation. The point of view of an end user is a differnt one
   from the point of view of an implementor. Thus it is highly desirable to
   have differnt people for implementing and documenting.
   </p>

   <h1>Wanted</h1> 

    Maybe different people can cooperate to produce ducmentation in different
    languages:
   <ul>
     <li>Someone with skills in writing and &LaTeX; is needed to
     produce end user documentation.
     </li>
   </ul>
