   <h1>ExTeX Debugger</h1> 

   <p>
   Debugging is a nasty task in &TeX;. What is missing is a modern debugger
   with all the possibilities we have in IDEs:
   </p>
   <ul>
   <li>Single-step the execution</li>
   <li>Set break points</li>
   <li>Watch expressions</li>
   <li>Inspect the internal state</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
   &ExTeX; is prepared for this task. Several points for obsering the internal
   machinery and intervening are provided. On the other side the framework of
   Eclipse is well prepared to develop a debugger. This can lead to a
   &ExTeX; debugger with a graphical user interface.
   </p>
   <p>
   On both sides the debugger can rely on well-defined interfaces. On the
   &ExTeX; side requests for further functionality might be necessary. The
   debugger to be developed has to provide the glue code between the two
   worlds.
   </p>

   <h1>Wanted</h1> 

   <ul>
     <li>Someone with skills in Java to do the implementation.
     </li>
   </ul>
