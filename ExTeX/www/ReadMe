
This tree contains a simple generator for a Web site written in Perl.

The aim is the ease of maintainance for normal content of pages. They
are stored as simple HTML files and augmented automatically upon
publication.

The layout is separated form the content and stored in several files.
This makes it very easy to adapt the appearance without touching the
contents.

The sources are kept in the subdirectory src.
The generated files are put into the subdirectory www.
Both locations can be configured.

To generate the Web site run the following command:

	make

This command creates a complete directory hierarchy with all
subdirectories in www. An exception are the directories named CVS.
Those directories are ignored.

The files starting with . or ending in ~ or in .bak are also ignored.
The files not ending in .html are copied into the destination tree.
The files ending in .html are processed as follows:
	Text is inserted before the </head> tag from the file .headEnd.
	Text is inserted after the <body> tag from the file .bodyStart.
	Text is inserted before the </body> tag from the file .bodyEnd.

The text to be inserted is sought in the current directory and in case
of failure upwards in the super-directories until it is found. In the
inserted files the following tags are replaced:

	&top;
		this is the relative path to the top directory.
	&year;
		this is the current year when generating.
	&month;
		this is the current month when generating.
	&day;
		this is the current day when generating.
	<tabs/>
		this is replaced by the contents of the file .tabs.
	<navigation/>
		this is replaced by the contents of the file .navigation.
	<info/>
		this is replaced by the contents of the file .info.


The current layout has the following scheme:
