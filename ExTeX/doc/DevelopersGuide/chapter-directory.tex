\chapter{The Source Tree Organization}

In this section the description of the directory hierarchy is
contained. This structure is oriented on the structuring proposed by
Maven (\url{http://maven.apache.org}).


\section{The Toplevel Directory}

The toplevel directory of an \ExTeX\ project contains certain files
and sub-directories.

\begin{description}
\item[develop] \ \\
  The sub-directory \texttt{develop} contains bits and pieces needed
  for development only.
\item[doc]  \ \\
  The sub-directory \texttt{doc} contains documentation -- papers
  written by the \ExTeX\ Group and material collected from elsewhere.
\item[lib]  \ \\
  The sub-directory \texttt{lib} contains libraries which need to be
  present for the final executable to run.
\item[src]  \ \\
  The sub-directory \texttt{src} contains the sources.
\item[target]  \ \\
  The sub-directory \texttt{target} contains the generated files. This
  directory is not present in the CVS archive.
\item[tmp]  \ \\
  The sub-directory \texttt{tmp} may contain intermediary files. This
  directory is not present in the CVS archive.
\item[util]  \ \\
  The sub-directory \texttt{util} contains some utilities for
  development. They are not included into the installer.
\item[work]  \ \\
  The sub-directory \texttt{work} may contain working files of single
  developers. It is not shared via the repositiory.
\item[www]  \ \\
  The sub-directory \texttt{www} contains the sources for the Web pages
  of \ExTeX.
