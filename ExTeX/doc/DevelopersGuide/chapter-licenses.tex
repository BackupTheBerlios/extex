\chapter{Licenses for \ExTeX}
\footnotetext{Author: Bastien Roucaries}%

The project goal of \ExTeX\ is to provide a typesetting library
facility.  The global licence of the heart of \ExTeX\ is therefore the
LGPL. But in order to keep open linking facility against all the
different licenses we must be choose carefully third party program
licenses, i.e. jar files.

\section{Acceptable Licenses}

The licence that we accept and why:

\begin{itemize}
\item LGPL\\
  for obvious reasons.
\item  modified BSD licence
  (\url{http://www.xfree86.org/3.3.6/COPYRIGHT2.html#5})\\
  We can always convert this licence to LGPL.
\item  Apache 2.0 licence \\
  Unfortunately linking with GPL2 programs is in gray area.
  Interpretation differs between FSF and Apache but GPLv3 will be
  compatible.
\item Public domain\\
  (obvious)
\item GPL with explicit linking clause that don't enforce viral clause
  of GPL and insure clear encapsulation of GPL license. It is the GPL
  with this special exception like this:

  \begin{quote}
    As a special exception, if other files instantiate templates or
    use macros or inline functions from this file, or you compile this
    file and link it with other works to produce a work based on this
    file, this file does not by itself cause the resulting work to be
    covered by the GNU General Public License.  However the source
    code for this file must still be made available in accordance with
    section (3) of the GNU General Public License.
  \end{quote}
	   
  or like this:
	   
  \begin{quote}
    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules
    is making a combined work based on this library. Thus, the terms
    and conditions of the G NU General Public License cover the whole
    combination.
  
    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
    you permission to link this library with independent modules to
    produce an executable, regardless of the license terms of these
    independent modules, and to copy and distribute the resulting
    executable under terms of your choice, provided that you also
    meet, for each linked independent module, the terms and conditions
    of the license of that module. An independent module is a module
    which is not derived from or based on this library. If you modify
    this library, you may extend this exception to your version of the
    library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish
    to do so, delete this exception statement from your version.
  \end{quote}

\end{itemize}

\section{Non-Acceptable Licenses}

The licence that \emph{don't} accept and why:

\begin{itemize}
\item GPL license:\\
  We would loose the free linking facility.
\item Apache 1.1 license:\\
  It forbids linking with GPL software. Check if an upgrade to
  Apache~2.0 exists.
\item Eclipse public license:\\
  It forbids linking with GPL software and has nasty side effects for
  proprietary software.  Perhaps side effects exist with Apache 2.0
  due to patents issue.
\item Original BSD license and Apache 1.0\\
  Have a boring clause that forbids linking with a lot of different
  licenses -- particularly GPL -- and non carefully written
  proprietary software.
\end{itemize}
