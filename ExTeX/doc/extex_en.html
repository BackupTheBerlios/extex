    <h1>ExTeX</h1>

    <h2>Michael Niedermair, Rolf Niepraschk, Torsten Krueger, Markus
    Kohm, David Kastrup</h2>

    <p>
      In December 2002 a small group of consultative experts and
      developers came together to launch the creation of a new
      derivate of <span class="sysname">TeX</span>, based on <span
      class="sysname">NTS</span>. Initially there were a few ideas and
      the necessity to familiarise with existing sources and <span
      class="sysname">TeX</span> extensions. After a lot of
      experiments and examinations, and yet before the group's first
      closed meeting from October 3rd to 5th, it was clear that the
      ambitious goals could be achieved only if large parts of <span
      class="sysname">TeX</span> &ndash; and with it <span
      class="sysname">NTS</span> &ndash; were substituted. This led to the
      decision to develop a new Java-based system, using the
      experiences with <span class="sysname">NTS</span>, <span
      class="sysname">&epsilon;-TeX</span>, <span
      class="sysname">pdfTeX</span>, and <span class="sysname">&Omega;
      (Omega)</span>: <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span>. In this
      article we will render the current state of progress and
      planning.  Additionally we will request for further suggestions
      and discussion of our conception.
    </p>

    <img src="./moduledesign.gif" alt="the modular design of ExTeX" style="float:right;padding:12px 12px 24px 24px" />

    <h3>Modularity</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span>'s object-oriented design (see
      figure) includes some main modules that act without knowledge
      about the functioning of the other modules (encapsulation). Thus
      the frontend with tokenisation and the expansion of tokens, up to
      the creation of nodes are exchangeable, independently from the
      typesetter. The same applies to the backend that generates the
      output. A special role plays the font module that provides font
      information to the typesetter as well as to the output module.
    </p>
    <p>
      Inside the main modules other subdivisons are established, making
      subtitution or enhancement of single aspects of a function
      possible. So the font module may be extended to new formats by
      adding or replacing a font reader, without directly affecting
      other parts of the program. Likewise new algorithms may be
      integrated into the typesetter that is responsible for line
      breaking and the structure of the page.
    </p>

    <h3>Compatibility</h3>

    <p>
      <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span> will provide all of <span
      class="sysname">TeX</span>'s primitives. Since syntax and function
      of some primitives (e.g. <span class="code">\input</span>) leads
      to undesirable constraints on modern systems, supplemental
      primitives will be designed and implemented in these cases. The
      old variants will clearly be marked obsolete. In some cases this
      has been done already. Hardly understandable peculiarities of
      <span class="sysname">TeX</span> can be abandoned in favour of a
      clean implementation. Moreover the behaviour in case of an error
      will not be emulated completely equally. Eventually <span
      class="sysname">ExTeX</span> shall be able to typeset existing
      documents visually identically to <span
      class="sysname">TeX</span>.
    </p>


    <p>
      <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span> will not be compatible
      regarding the strict separation of <span
      class="sysname">iniTeX</span> and <span
      class="sysname">virTeX</span>. So far, loading of hyphenation
      patterns and creation of format files is possible only for <span
      class="sysname">iniTeX</span>. <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span>
      on the other hand shall be able to load hyphenation patterns
      globally at any time, i.e. it shall not be limited to hyphenation
      tables that are stored in the format files.  Therefore it will be
      possible to load only those hyphenation tables at runtime that are
      actually needed. <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span> also has the
      ablility to create a format under particular conditions, namely
      outside of any group.
    </p>

    <p>
      From <span class="sysname">&epsilon;-TeX</span> mainly those facilities
      will be adopted whose main effect is not limited to the logging
      messages. The additional tracing primitives are not adopted to the
      vocabulary of <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span> because <span
      class="sysname">ExTeX</span> will provide its own progressive
      facilities for debugging purposes. The facilities of <span
      class="sysname">&epsilon;-TeX</span> to toggle the direction of writing
      will be omitted, too. These can be realised with the help of <span
      class="sysname">&Omega;</span>-compatible primitives on macro
      level. Thus compatibility to real existing <span
      class="sysname">&epsilon;-TeX</span> documents should be obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      From <span class="sysname">&Omega;</span> the extensions regarding
      the fonts will be taken, as well as the feature of setting the
      direction of writing.  However <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span>
      will not adopt the encoding functions of <span
      class="sysname">&Omega;</span>, but instead realise 16-bit
      capability with its own easily comprehensible methodes. Here
      established basic facilities of Java will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two kinds of <span class="sysname">pdfTeX</span>
      features: those controlling PDF output, and those providing
      additional typographic features. The latter shall be widely
      adopted. Here the problem arises that in <span
      class="sysname">pdfTeX</span> these primitives are prefixed with
      »<span class="code">pdf</span>«, too. Hence new names and
      partially other primitives will replace them in <span
      class="sysname">ExTeX</span>. As above, macros may be used as the
      connective link. In most cases, e.g. with <span
      class="sysname">LaTeX</span> packages like <span
      class="code">graphics</span> or <span
      class="code">hyperref</span>, a change to a new driver is
      recommended. This all the more, as the way to implement
      capabilities that are strongly depenent on the backend is
      different in <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span>.
    </p>

    <h3>New features</h3>

    <p>
      Although <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span> is designed so that
      new facilities can easily be added to every main module &ndash;
      actually on the level of primitives &ndash; <span
      class="sysname">ExTeX</span> will right from start be equipped
      with some innovations. One of these is the handling of different
      encodings of input files. At this <span
      class="sysname">ExTeX</span> uses Java's built-in facilities to
      transfer read characters into an internal 32-bit coding.
    </p>
    <p>
      As several of <span class="sysname">TeX</span>'s primitives are
      limited to 8-bit, and <span class="sysname">&Omega;</span> to
      16-bit, new appropriate equivalents will be defined, e.g. for
      <span class="code">\mathcode</span>. On the other hand, <span
      class="code">\char</span> will be able to handle values greater
      than 255 directly. Actually this is an incompatibility to <span
      class="sysname">TeX</span>, but since <span
      class="sysname">TeX</span> would report an error in this case,
      this behaviour is compatible to existing error-free documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      Expansions that do not depend on a specific output format, but are
      &ndash; even in various ways &ndash; supported by different output
      formats, will have their own primitives. Examples for this are the
      begin and end of links as well as their targets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="sysname">TeX</span> knows elements that do not deal
      with typography of the page, but they must be processed when it is
      outputted (<span class="code">\shipout</span>). Examples for this
      <em>whatsits</em> are <span class="code">\openout</span>, <span
      class="code">\closeout</span> and <span
      class="code">\write</span>, always without being prefixed with
      <span class="code">\immediate</span>. Especially these should not
      have any effect on page breaking, which can't be guaranteed by
      <span class="sysname">TeX</span> really. This deficency shall be
      improved in <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span>, despite arising
      incompatibilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the <em>whatsits</em>, the <span
      class="code">\special</span> primitive plays a special role.
      Depending on its meaning, it may have effects on line or page
      breaking (e.g. if a graphic is inserted), or not (e.g. if colour
      is changed).  Apart from the fact that <span
      class="sysname">ExTeX</span> will support colours directly, <span
      class="sysname">ExTeX</span> will have a new primitive for
      extensions that depend on the output format.  When encountering
      this primitive, the typesetter will demand the decision whether
      the element affects line or page breaking from the backend (see
      IObject and Boxsize in the figure).  For example, a PDF backend
      may return the size of an image that was inserted by this
      primitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Medium-term <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span> shall provide
      graphical elements like lines of arbitrary gradient, ellipses,
      bezier curves etc.  Also graphical transformations like rotation,
      reflexion, or scaling shall be realised.
    </p>

    <h3>Implemented so far</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>
	<strong>Tokenizer:</strong>
	<p>
	  The tokenizer generates single tokens from various sources
	  (e.g. a file) and provides them in a stack.  The encoding of
	  each file is taken into account, which can also be
          set by a primitive.  All of Java's standard encodings are
	  supported (others may be defined in special cases).
	</p>
	<p>
	  Special or unicode characters can be read in various ways:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	  Standard <span class="sysname">TeX</span> variant:&nbsp;<span
	      class="code">^^...</span>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	  Unicode:&nbsp;<span class="code">^^^<em>Unicodename;</em></span>
	  </li>

	  <li>
	  Omega variant:&nbsp;<span class="code">^^^^<em>Hex-number</em></span>
	  </li>
	</ul>

	<p>
	  The TokenizerStack may be shown optionally in a window (visual
	  debugger), in order to follow the progress and generation of
	  tokens.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<strong>Filemanager</strong>
	<p>
	  All files are loaded by a central FileManager.  All accesses
	  are cached.  The FileManager searches and loads files in
	  directories defined in <span class="var">TEXINPUTS</span>, and
	  additionally in given JAR archives.
	</p>
	<p>
	  Newly created files are saved to the directory <span
	  class="var">TEXOUTPUTS</span>, or to the current one.  If it
	  is not writeable, the substitution directory <span
	  class="var">TEXMFOUTPUT</span> is used instead.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<strong>EqTable</strong>
	<p>
	  The EqTable takes all primitives, parameters etc. and stores
	  them in the appropriate group levels.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This table (the keys and their according values) may
	  optionally be shown in a special window (visual debugger), in
	  order to track values etc.  A filter is provided for setting
	  the visible range.  A breakpoint mechanism allows to stop the
	  processing if the value of an entry changes.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<strong>Log Output</strong>
	<p>
	  Output is generated according to the applied filter
	  (separately for terminal and logfile).  An appropriate output
	  encoding may be specified, too.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<strong>Registers</strong>
	<p>
	  Registers are not explicitly limited to a certain size.  It
	  only depends on the counter (a 32-bit integer is used) and the
	  available memory.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<strong>Primitives</strong>
	<p>
	  &hellip;&nbsp;are considered step-by-step.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Unsolved things</h3>

    <p>
      A large part of what is to be programmed in <span
      class="sysname">ExTeX</span> shall provide the same functionality
      as <span class="sysname">TeX</span> does.  The way to go is
      determined by and large, but not always easy because it's desired
      to get a structure as modular as possible.  The extensions offered
      by <span class="sysname">&epsilon;-TeX</span> will probably be
      realised similarly to the already implemented primitives and
      operators of <span class="sysname">TeX</span>.  However the
      following (so far only suggested) extensions and modifications are
      different. They require a more intense analysis of the matter.
      Hence the ##placing## of diplomas and thesis on them would be
      perfect:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	<p>
	  Typesetting of paragraphs that differ from the usual
	  rectangular shape.  We look for a general solution that
	  provides more than what is offered by the <span
	  class="code">\parshape</span> primitive.  A lot of
          difficulties arise if multiple attempts of breaking these
	  paragraphs are considered, as well as breaking of pages.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	<p>
	  Fonts management. The way <span class="sysname">TeX</span>
	  currently deals with fonts has many limitations which makes it
	  very awkward.  The internal use of 32-bit encoded characters
	  in <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span> aggravates the problem.
	  The following briefly mentioned problems are related to that:
	</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    micro adjustment of kerning and letter size
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    protruding characters
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    letterspacing and the like
	  </li>

	  <li>
	    right-to-left typesetting
	  </li>
	</ul>

      <li>
	<p>
	  The possibility to optimise line and page breaking across
	  several pages.  It would be desirable to have alternative page
	  breaks of certain pages calculated within a single <span
	  class="sysname">ExTeX</span> run, and to have improper results
	  rejected.  Apart from technical questions about this kind of
	  optimisation a basic strategy is widely unknown.  This is
	  connected with the possibility to typeset only single pages or
	  even parts of it, instead of a complete document.  This would
	  help to build a WYSIWYG <span class="sysname">TeX</span>.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li>
	So-called &ldquo;backing up&rdquo; of boxes of a page.  This
	means that lines of text may be positioned only at specific
	vertical locations of the page, so that adjacent pages harmonise
	better with each other.  Considering that a page does not only
	contain text lines of equal size, but also graphics,
	mathematical formulae etc, a solution is expected to be not
	trivial.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Call for support</h2>

    <p>
      During the three days while the <span class="sysname">ExTeX</span>
      team intensively discussed own and potential expectations
      regarding a new typesetting program, it became obvious that we
      could not completely evaluate all aspects.  In several fields we
      were simply lacking necessary competence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover there are more or less urgent wishes, expecially from
      format and package developers, we did not think of at all so far.
      We hope that this article will help to make people to tell us
      these wishes.  Futher articles about certain aspects of <span
      class="sysname">ExTeX</span> will possibly follow.  It would be
      helpful however that important problems or ideas would early
      (i.e. before the development and implementation of fundamental
      functions) be sent to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      As refered in the secton »unsolved things« there are many fields
      where new concepts are to be developed.  Here and on the plain
      implementation, support is welcomed and desired.
    </p>
