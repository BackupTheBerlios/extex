  This package contains the definitions and implementations for the TFM-font-metric handling in
  ExTeX.

  <a name="TFMformat"/><h2>TFM format</h2>

  <p>
  Definition of TFM format taken from TFtoPL 3.1 and<br/>
  &quot;The TUG DVI driver standards committee: DVI driver standard, level 0&quot;
  </p>
  <p>
  The information in a TFM file appears in a sequence of 8-bit bytes.
  Since the number of bytes is always a multiple of 4, we could
  also regard the file as a sequence of 32-bit words; but TeX uses
  the byte interpretation, and so do we.
  Note that the bytes are considered to be unsigned numbers.
  </p>

  <h3>The header</h3>

  The first 24 bytes (6 words) of a TFM file contain twelve
  16-bit integers that give the lengths of the various subsequent
  portions of the file.<br/>

  These twelve integers are, in order:

 <table border="1">
 <tr><td>lf</td><td>length of the entire file, in words</td></tr>
 <tr><td>lh</td><td>length of the header data, in words</td></tr>
 <tr><td>bc</td><td>smallest character code in the font</td></tr>
 <tr><td>ec</td><td>largest character code in the font</td></tr>
 <tr><td>nw</td><td>number of words in the width table</td></tr>
 <tr><td>nh</td><td>number of words in the height table</td></tr>
 <tr><td>nd</td><td>number of words in the depth table</td></tr>
 <tr><td>ni</td><td>number of words in the italic correction table</td></tr>
 <tr><td>nl</td><td>number of words in the lig/kern table</td></tr>
 <tr><td>nk</td><td>number of words in the kern table</td></tr>
 <tr><td>ne</td><td>number of words in the extensible character table</td></tr>
 <tr><td>np</td><td>number of font parameter words</td></tr>
 </table>

 <p>
 They are all nonnegative and less than 2^15.<br/>
 We must have bc-1 &lt; ec &lt; 255, ne &lt; 256, and<br/>
 lf = 6 + lh + (ec-bc+1) + nw + nh + nd + ni + nl + nk + ne + np.
 </p>
 <p>
 Note that a font may contain as many as 256 characters
 (if bc=0  and ec=255), and as few as 0 characters
 (if bc=ec+).
 </p>
 <p>
 Incidentally, when two or more 8-bit bytes are combined to form an
 integer of 16 or more bits, the most significant bytes appear first
 in the file. This is called BigEndian order.
 </p>

<a name="TFMdata"/> <h4>TFM data</h4>

 <p>
 The rest of the TFM file may be regarded as a sequence of ten
 data arrays having the informal specification.
</p>

<table border="1">
   <tr><td>header</td>   <td>array</td><td>0 to lh-1</td>  <td>of stuff</td></tr>
   <tr><td>char_info</td><td>array</td><td>bc to ec</td>   <td>of char_info_word</td></tr>
   <tr><td>width</td>    <td>array</td><td>0 to nw-1</td>  <td>of fix_word</td></tr>
   <tr><td>height</td>   <td>array</td><td>0 to nh-1</td>  <td>of fix_word</td></tr>
   <tr><td>depth</td>    <td>array</td><td>0 to nd-1</td>  <td>of fix_word</td></tr>
   <tr><td>italic</td>   <td>array</td><td>0 to ni-1</td>  <td>of fix_word</td></tr>
   <tr><td>lig_kern</td> <td>array</td><td>0 to nl-1</td>  <td>of lig_kern_command</td></tr>
   <tr><td>kern</td>     <td>array</td><td>0 to nk-1</td>  <td>of fix_word</td></tr>
   <tr><td>exten</td>    <td>array</td><td>0 to ne-1</td>  <td>of extensible_recipe</td></tr>
   <tr><td>param</td>    <td>array</td><td>1 to np</td>    <td>of fix_word</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
The most important data type used here is a fix_word, which is
a 32-bit representation of a binary fraction. A fix_word is a
signed quantity, with the two's complement of the entire word used to
represent negation. Of the 32 bits in a fix_word, exactly 12
are to the left of the binary point; thus, the largest fix_word
value is 2048-2^-20, and the smallest is -2048. We will see
below, however, that all but one of the fix_word values will
lie between -16 and +16.
</p>

<h5>header</h5>
<p>
The first data array is a block of header information, which contains
general facts about the font. The header must contain at least two
words, and for TFM files to be used with Xerox printing
software it must contain at least 18 words, allocated as described
below. When different kinds of devices need to be interfaced, it may
be necessary to add further words to the header block.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>header[0]</dt>
<dd>
is a 32-bit check sum that TeX will
copy into the DVI output file whenever it uses the font.  Later
on when the DVI file is printed, possibly on another computer,
the actual font that gets used is supposed to have a check sum that
agrees with the one in the TFM file used by TeX. In this way,
users will be warned about potential incompatibilities. (However, if
the check sum is zero in either the font file or the TFM file,
no check is made.)  The actual relation between this check sum and
the rest of the TFM file is not important; the check sum is
simply an identification number with the property that incompatible
fonts almost always have distinct check sums.
</dd>
<dt>header[1]</dt>
<dd>
is a fix_word containing the design
size of the font, in units of TeX points (7227 TeX points = 254
cm).  This number must be at least 1.0; it is fairly arbitrary, but
usually the design size is 10.0 for a &quot;10 point&quot; font,
i.e., a font that was designed to look best at a 10-point size, whatever that
really means. When a TeX user asks for a font `at &delta; pt',
the effect is to override the design size and replace it
by &delta;, and to multiply the x and y coordinates of the
points in the font image by a factor of &delta; divided by the
design size.<br/>
All other dimensions in the TFM file are
fix_word-1pt numbers in design-size units.<br/>
Thus, for
example, the value of param[6], one em or \quad,
is often the fix_word value 2^20=1.0, since many fonts have
a design size equal to one em. The other dimensions must be less than
16 design-size units in absolute value; thus, header[1] and
param[1] are the only fix_word entries in the whole
TFM file whose first byte might be something besides 0 or 255.
</dd>
<dt>header[2..11]</dt>
<dd>
if present, contains 40 bytes that
identify the character coding scheme. The first byte, which must be
between 0 and 39, is the number of subsequent ASCII bytes actually
relevant in this string, which is intended to specify what
character-code-to-symbol convention is present in the font.  Examples
are ASCII for standard ASCII, TeX text for fonts like
cmr10 and cmti9, TeX math extension for
cmex10, XEROX text for Xerox fonts, GRAPHIC for
special-purpose non-alphabetic fonts, UNSPECIFIED for the
default case when there is no information.  Parentheses should not
appear in this name. (Such a string is said to be in BCPL
format.)
</dd>
<dt>header[12..16]</dt>
<dd>
if present, contains 20 bytes that
name the font family (e.g., CMR or HELVETICA), in BCPL format.
This field is also known as the &quot;font identifier&quot;.
</dd>
<dt>header[17]</dt>
<dd>
if present, contains a first byte
called the seven_bit_safe_flag, then two bytes that are
ignored, and a fourth byte called the face. If the value of the
fourth byte is less than 18, it has the following interpretation as a
&quot;weight, slope, and expansion&quot;:  Add 0 or 2 or 4 (for medium or
bold or light) to 0 or 1 (for roman or italic) to 0 or 6 or 12 (for
regular or condensed or extended).  For example, 13 is 0+1+12, so it
represents medium italic extended.  A three-letter code (e.g.,
MIE) can be used for such face data.
</dd>
<dt>header[18... xx]</dt>
<dd>
might also be present;
the individual words are simply called header[18],
header[19], etc., at the moment.
</dd>
</dl>

<h5>char_info</h5>
<p>
Next comes the char_info array, which contains one
char_info_word per character. Each char_info_word
contains six fields packed into four bytes as follows.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>first byte</dt>   <dd>width_index (8 bits)</dd>
<dt>second byte</dt>  <dd>height_index (4 bits) times 16, plus depth_index}
                          (4~bits)</dd>
<dt>third byte</dt>   <dd>italic_index} (6 bits) times 4, plus tag 2~bits)</dd>
<dt>fourth byte</dt>  <dd>remainder (8 bits)</dd>
</dl>

<p>
The actual width of a character is width}[width_index}],
in design-size units; this is a device for compressing information,
since many characters have the same width. Since it is quite common
for many characters to have the same height, depth, or italic
correction, the TFM format imposes a limit of 16 different
heights, 16 different depths, and 64 different italic corrections.
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the relation
width[0]=height[0]=depth[0]=italic[0]=0 should
always hold, so that an index of zero implies a value of zero. The
width_index should never be zero unless the character does not
exist in the font, since a character is valid if and only if it lies
between bc and ec and has a nonzero width_index.
</p>

<h5>char_info_word</h5>
<p>
The tag field in a char_info_word} has four values that
explain how to interpret the remainder field.
</p>
<dl>
<dt>tag=0 (no_tag)</dt>   <dd>means that remainder is unused.</dd>
<dt>tag=1 (lig_tag)</dt>  <dd>means that this character has a ligature/kerning program starting at lig_kern[remainder].</dd>
<dt>tag=2 (list_tag)</dt> <dd>means that this character is part of a chain of characters of ascending sizes, and not the largest in the chain.  The remainder field gives the character code of the next larger character.</dd>
<dt>tag=3 (ext_tag)</dt>  <dd>means that this character code represents an extensible character, i.e., a character that is built up of smaller pieces so that it can be made arbitrarily large. The pieces are specified in exten[remainder].</dd>
</dl>


<a name="lig_kern"/><h5>lig_kern</h5>

The lig_kern array contains instructions in a simple
programming language that explains what to do for special letter
pairs. Each word is a lig_kern_command of four bytes.

<dl>
<dt>first byte</dt>     <dd>skip_byte, indicates that this is the final program step if the byte is 128 or more, otherwise the next step is obtained by skipping this number of intervening steps.</dd>
<dt>second byte</dt>    <dd>next_char: &quot;if next_char follows the current character, then perform the operation and stop, otherwise continue.&quot;</dd>
<dt>third byte</dt>     <dd>op_byte, indicates a ligature step if less than 128, a kern step otherwise.</dd>
<dt>fourth byte</dt>    <dd>remainder</dd>
</dl>

<p>
In a kern step, an additional space equal to
kern[256(op_byte-128)+remainder] is inserted
between the current character and next_char. This amount is
often negative, so that the characters are brought closer together by
kerning; but it might be positive.
</p>
<p>
There are eight kinds of ligature steps, having op_byte codes
4a+2b+c where 0 &lt; a &lt; b+c and 0 &lt; b, c &lt; 1. The character whose
code is remainder is inserted between the current character and
next_char; then the current character is deleted if b=0, and
next_char is deleted if c=0; then we pass over a characters
to reach the next current character (which may have a
ligature/kerning program of its own).
</p>
<p>
Notice that if a=0 and b=1, the current character is unchanged;
if a=b and c=1, the current character is changed but the next
character is unchanged.
</p>
<p>
If the very first instruction of the lig_kern array has
skip_byte=255, the next_char byte is the so-called
right boundary character of this font; the value of next_char
need not lie between bc and ec. If the very last
instruction of the lig_kern array has skip_byte=255,
there is a special ligature/kerning program for a left boundary
character, beginning at location
256op_byte+remainder. The interpretation is that
TeX puts implicit boundary characters before and after each
consecutive string of characters from the same font. These implicit
characters do not appear in the output, but they can affect ligatures
and kerning.
</p>
<p>
If the very first instruction of a character's lig_kern program
has skip_byte&gt;128, the program actually begins in location
256op_byte+remainder. This feature allows access to
large lig_kern arrays, because the first instruction must
otherwise appear in a location &lt;255.
</p>
<p>
Any instruction with skip_byte&gt;128 in the lig_kern
array must have 256op_byte+remainder&lt;nl. If
such an instruction is encountered during normal program execution,
it denotes an unconditional halt; no ligature command is performed.
</p>


<h5>extensible_recipe</h5>
<p>
Extensible characters are specified by an extensible_recipe,
which consists of four bytes called top, mid, bot, and
rep (in this order). These bytes are the character codes of
individual pieces used to build up a large symbol. If top,
mid, or bot are zero, they are not present in the built-up
result. For example, an extensible vertical line is like an
extensible bracket, except that the top and bottom pieces are
missing.
</p>

<h5>param</h5>
<p>
The final portion of a TFM file is the param
array, which is another sequence of fix_word values.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>param[1]=slant</dt>
<dd>
is the amount of italic slant,
which is used to help position accents. For example,
slant=0.25 means that when you go up one unit, you also go
0.25 units to the right. The slant} is a pure number; it's the
only fix_word other than the design size itself that is not
scaled by the design size.
</dd>
<dt>param[2]=space</dt>
<dd>
is the normal spacing between words
in text. Note that character &quot; &quot; in the font need not have
anything to do with blank spaces.
</dd>
<dt>param[3]=space_stretch</dt>
<dd>
is the amount of glue stretching between words.
</dd>
<dt>param[4]=space_shrink</dt>
<dd>
is the amount of glue shrinking between words.
</dd>
<dt>param[5]=x_height</dt>
<dd>
is the height of letters for which accents don't have to be raised or lowered.
</dd>
<dt>param[6]=quad</dt>
<dd>
is the size of one em in the font.
</dd>
<dt>param[7]=extra_space</dt>
<dd>
is the amount added to param[2] at the ends of sentences.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>

When the character coding scheme is TeX math symbols, the font
is supposed to have 15 additional parameters called num1,
num2, num3, denom1, denom2, sup1, sup2,
sup3, sub1, sub2, supdrop, subdrop,
delim1, delim2, and axis_height, respectively. When
the character coding scheme is TeX math extension, the font is
supposed to have six additional parameters called
default_rule_thickness and big_op_spacing1 through
big_op_spacing5.
