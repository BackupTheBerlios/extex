        This package contains the definitions and implementations for the 
        VF-font-metric handling in ExTeX. <a name="VFformat"/>

        <p>Definition of VF format taken from VFtoVP, Version 1.2</p> 
        <p>
        VFtoVP is an extended version of the program TFtoPL, which is part of 
        the standard TEXware library. The idea of a virtual font was inspired 
        by the work of David R. Fuchs who designed a similar set of conventions 
        in 1984 while developing a device driver for ArborText, Inc. He wrote a 
        somewhat similar program called AMFtoXPL.
        </p> 
        <p>
	     The idea behind VF files is that a general interface mechanism is
         needed to switch between the myriad font layouts provided by different
         suppliers of typesetting equipment. Without such a mechanism, people
         must go to great lengths writing inscrutable macros whenever they
         want to use typesetting conventions based on one font layout in
         connection with actual fonts that have another layout.
         This puts an extra burden on the typesetting system, interfering
         with the other things it needs to do (like kerning, hyphenation, and
         ligature formation). These difficulties go away when we have a
         virtual font,  i.e., a font that exists in a logical sense but
         not a physical sense. A typesetting system like TEX can do its
         job without knowing where the actual characters come from;
         a device driver can then do its job by letting a VF file tell what
         actual characters correspond to the characters TEX imagined were
         present. The actual characters can be shifted and/or magnified
         and/or combined with other characters from many diffrent fonts.
         A virtual font can even make use of characters from virtual fonts,
         including itself. Virtual fonts also allow convenient character
         substitutions for proofreading purposes, when fonts designed for one
         output device are unavailable on another.
