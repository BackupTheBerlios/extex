  </div>

  <dl>
   <dt><b>Main</b></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     The Main component encapsulates everything necessary to run
     <logo>ExTeX</logo> from the command line. This includes the evaluation
     of the command line arguments as well as handling the interaction with
     the user &ndash; e.g. in case of an error. The remaining components
     should not know anything about were the input is coming from or where
     it is going to.
    </p>
    <p>
     This component is located in the package Main.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt><b>ExTeX</b></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     The component called <b>ExTeX</b> is in fact just the glue which

     point for any client using the <logo>ExTeX</logo> functionality.
    </p>
    <p>
     This component is located in this package.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt><b>Input Subsystem</b></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     The component called <b>Input Subsystem</b> provides everything
     to process the input from some raw bytes until a scanner has made
     tokens out of them. A general purpose preprocessing might be
     included into this process.
    </p>
    <p>
     This component is located in the package Interpreter.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt><b>Interpreter Subsystem</b></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     The component called <b>Interpreter Subsystem</b> provides an
     interpreter for the <logo>TeX</logo> language. This includes an
     engine to parse instructions &ndash; ased on the tokens passed in
     from the input subsystem &ndash; and evaluate them.
    </p>
    <p>
     This component is located in the package Interpreter.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt><b>Typesetting Subsystem</b></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     The component called <b>Typesetting Subsystem</b> provides the
     typesetting funtionality. It places objects on the page. These
     objects are mainly characters or boxes filled with characters or
     boxes.
    </p>

   <dt><b>Font Subsystem</b></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     The component called <b>Font Subsystem</b> provides means to deal
     with fonts of several kinds. The abstraction provided by the
     component encapsulates the technical details of the fonts from
     the rest of the system.
    </p>

   <dt><b>Backend Subsystem</b></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     The component called <b>Backend Subsystem</b> provides means to
     translate the page description into an external format. The only
     format knon by <logo>TeX</logo> is supproted as well as some
     others. Tis translation might involve some postprocessing on the
     level of pages. For instance the selection or re-arranging of
     pages can be accomplished here.

   </dd>
   <dt><b>Framework</b></dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     The component called <b>Framework</b> is in fact not a component
     of its own. It just provides cross-cutting functionality needed
