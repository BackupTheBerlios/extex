ExTeX.Usage=\
    \nUsage: {0} <options> file\n\
    \nUsage: tex [OPTION]... [TEXNAME[.tex]] [COMMANDS]\
    \n   or: tex [OPTION]... \FIRST-LINE\
    \n   or: tex [OPTION]... &FMT ARGS\
    \n\
    \n  Run TeX on TEXNAME, usually creating TEXNAME.dvi.\
    \n  Any remaining COMMANDS are processed as TeX input, after TEXNAME is read.\
    \n  If the first line of TEXNAME is %&FMT, and FMT is an existing .fmt file,\
    \n  use it.  Else use `NAME.fmt'', where NAME is the program invocation name,\
    \n  most commonly `tex''.\
    \n\
    \n  Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a backslash,\
    \n  interpret all non-option arguments as a line of TeX input.\
    \n\
    \n  Alternatively, if the first non-option argument begins with a &, the\
    \n  next word is taken as the FMT to read, overriding all else.  Any\
    \n  remaining arguments are processed as above.\
    \n\
    \n  If no arguments or options are specified, prompt for input.\
