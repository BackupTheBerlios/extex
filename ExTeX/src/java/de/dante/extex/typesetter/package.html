  This package contains the typesetter definitions for ExTeX. The typesetter
  has the aim of building lists of nodes and compute their optimal distribution.

  <h1>The Way to the Document Writer</h1>
  <p>In this section we want to see which instances are involved to
  come to a page being sent to the
  {@link de.dante.extex.backend.documentWriter.DocumentWriter DocumentWriter}.
  For this purpose we consider the sequence diagram in the figure below.</p>
  <div class="Figure">
   <img src="doc-files/SD_par.png" />
   <br />
   <caption>Sequence Diagram: A Page Break</caption>
  </div>
  <p>The start of out consideration is at the par primitive wich is
  triggered in TeX explicitely or implicitely when two empty lines are
  encountered. The primitive has a
  {@link de.dante.extex.typesetter.Typesetter Typesetter} at hand and
  forwards the message to this typesetter.
  </p>

  <p>The typesetter maintains a stack of 
  {@link de.dante.extex.typesetter.listMaker.ListMaker ListMaker}s. If
  the top of this stack is a horizontal list then it is closed first.
  this leaves a vertical list
  ({@link de.dante.extex.typesetter.listMaker.HorizontalListMaker HorizontalListMaker}).
  The par message is propagated to the list maker at the top of the stack.
  </p>

  <p>The horizontal list maker instructs his manager &ndash; which is
  also the typesetter &ndash; to build the paragraph. The typesetter
  propagates this message to the
  {@link de.dante.extex.typeseter.paragraphBuilder.ParagraphBuilder ParagraphBuilder}.
  </p>

  <p>When the contents is added to the topmost list maker &ndash;
  which is the global vertical list &ndash; the page builder is
  triggered. It tries to determine whether the page is full enough and
  invokes the output routine
  </p>

  <p>The output routine is an implementation of the interface
  {@link de.dante.extex.typesetter.OutputRoutine OutputRoutine}. The
  TeX implementation for the output routine executes some tokens with
  the help of an interpreter. In the course of this execution the
  primitive <tt>\shipout</tt> can be used to send some material to the
  document writer.
  </p>

  <p>The primitive asks the typesetter to perform the shipout. Thus
  the material is finaly forwarded to the document writer.
  </p>
