TTP.NonEmptyOutBox={0}{1} is not void
TTP.NonEmptyOutBox.help=You shouldn''t use \\box255 except in \\output routines.\n\
        Proceed, and I''ll discard its present contents.
# TTP [1024]
TTP.TooMuchDead=Output loop---{0} consecutive dead cycles
TTP.TooMuchDead.help=I''ve concluded that your \\output is awry; it never does a\n\
        \\shipout, so I''m shipping \\box255 out myself. Next time\n\
        increase \\maxdeadcycles if you want me to be more patient!
# TTP [1027]
TTP.UnbalancedOutput=Unbalanced output routine
TTP.UnbalancedOutput.help=Your sneaky output routine has problematic {''s and/or }''s.\n\

# TTP [1028]
TTP.NonEmptyOutBoxAfter=Output routine didn''t use all of {0}{1}
TTP.NonEmptyOutBoxAfter.help=Your \\output commands should empty \\box255,\n\
        e.g., by saying `\\shipout\\box255''.\n\
        Proceed; I''ll discard its present contents.
