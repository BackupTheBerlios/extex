TTP.InfShringInPar=Infinite glue shrinkage found in a paragraph
TTP.InfShringInPar.help=The paragraph just ended includes some glue that has\n\
        infinite shrinkability, e.g., `\\hskip 0pt minus 1fil''.\n\
        Such glue doesn''t belong there---it allows a paragraph\n\
        of any length to fit on one line. But it''s safe to proceed,\n\
        since the offensive shrinkability has been made finite.
