TTP.MisplacedCrSpan=Misplaced {0}
TTP.MisplacedCrSpan.help=I can''t figure out why you would want to use a tab mark\n\
        or \\cr or \\span just now. If something like a right brace\n\
        up above has ended a previous alignment prematurely,\n\
        you''re probably due for more error messages, and you\n\
        might try typing `S'' now just to see what is salvageable.
