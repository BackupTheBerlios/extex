  This package contains primitives for <logo>ExTeX</logo>'s
  <logo>TeX</logo> mode.

 <doc name="tracingrestores" type="register">
 <h3>The Count Parameter <tt>\tracingrestores</tt></h3>
 <p>
  The count register <tt>\tracingrestores</tt> contains controlls the
  logging of restore operations when the blocks are closed. The
  default implementation of <logo>ExTeX</logo> uses another
  mechanism. Thus this register has no effect at all.
 </p>
 <p>
  This register is a preassigned count register and can be used
  as such. Thus assignments and arithmetic can be performed on it.
 </p>

 <h4>Syntax</h4>
  The formal description of this primitive is the following:
  <pre class="syntax">
    &lang;tracingrestores&rang;
       &rarr; <tt>\tracingrestores</tt> ...  </pre>

 <h4>Examples</h4>
  <pre class="TeXSample">
    \tracingrestores=1  </pre>
