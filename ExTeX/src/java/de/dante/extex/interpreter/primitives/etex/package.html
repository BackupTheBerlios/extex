  This package contains primitives for <logo>ExTeX</logo>'s
  <logo>eTeX</logo> mode.

 <doc name="eTeXversion" type="register">
 <h3>The Count Parameter <tt>\eTeXversion</tt></h3>
 <p>
  The count register <tt>\eTeXversion</tt> contains the version
  number of <logo>eTeX</logo> as an integer. The number is multiplied
  by 100 to show the fractional part. For instance the value 123 signals
  the version number 1.23 of <logo>eTeX</logo>.
 </p>
 <p>
  The version number is a preassigned count register and can be used
  as such. Thus assignments and arithmetic can be performed on it.
 </p>

 <h4>Syntax</h4>
  The formal description of this primitive is the following:
  <pre class="syntax">
    &lang;eTeXversion&rang;
       &rarr; <tt>\eTeXversion</tt> ...  </pre>

 <h4>Examples</h4>
  <pre class="TeXSample">
    \the\eTeXversion  </pre>

 </doc>

 <doc name="eTeXrevision" type="register">
 <h3>The Tokens Parameter <tt>\eTeXrevision</tt></h3>
 <p>
  The tokens register <tt>\eTeXrevision</tt> contains the revision
  of <logo>eTeX</logo> in use. Usually this is something like a
  letter.
 </p>
 <p>
  The revision number is a preassigned tokens register and can be used
  as such. Thus assignments can be performed on it.
 </p>

 <h4>Syntax</h4>

  <pre class="syntax">
    &lang;eTeXrevision&rang;
