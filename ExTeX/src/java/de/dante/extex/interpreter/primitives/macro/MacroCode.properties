# TTP [338]
TTP.EOFinMatch=File ended while scanning use of {0}
TTP.EOFinMatch.help=I suspect you have forgotten a `}'', causing me\n\
        to read past where you wanted me to stop.\n\
        I''ll try to recover; but if the error is serious,\n\
        you''d better type `E'' or `X'' now and fix your file.
# TTP [396]
TTP.RunawayArg=Paragraph ended before {0} was complete
TTP.RunawayArg.help=I suspect you''ve forgotten a `}'', causing me to apply this\n\
        control sequence to too much text. How can we recover?\n\
        My plan is to forget the whole thing and hope for the best.
# TTP [398]
TTP.UseDoesntMatch=Use of {0} doesn''t match its definition
TTP.UseDoesntMatch.help=If you say, e.g., `\\def\\a1{...}'', then you must always\n\
        put `1'' after `\\a'', since control sequence names are\n\
        made up of letters only. The macro here has not been\n\
        followed by the required stuff, so I''m ignoring it.
