TTP.EOFinPreamble=File ended while scanning preamble of {0}
TTP.EOFinPreamble.help=I suspect you have forgotten a `'}''', causing me\n\
           to read past where you wanted me to stop.\n\
           I''ll try to recover; but if the error is serious,\n\
           you''d better type `E'' or `X'' now and fix your file.

TTP.OuterInPreamble=Forbidden control sequence found while scanning preamble of {0}

# TTP [783]
TTP.MissingSharp=Missing # inserted in alignment preamble
TTP.MissingSharp.help=There should be exactly one # between &''s, when an\n\
        \\halign or \\valign is being set up. In this case you had\n\
        none, so I''ve put one in; maybe that will work.
# TTP [784]
TTP.SecondSharpInTab=Only one # is allowed per tab
TTP.SecondSharpInTab.help=There should be exactly one # between &''s, when an\n\
        \\halign or \\valign is being set up. In this case you had\n\
        more than one, so I''m ignoring all but the first.
# TTP [792]
TTP.ExtraAlignTab=Extra alignment tab has been changed to {0}
TTP.ExtraAlignTab.help=You have given more \\span or & marks than there were\n\
        in the preamble to the \\halign or \\valign now in progress.\n\
        So I''ll assume that you meant to type \\cr instead.
