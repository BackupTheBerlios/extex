TTP.MissingInserted=Missing {0} inserted
TTP.MissingInserted.help=I''ve inserted something that you may have forgotten.\n\
        (See the <inserted text> above.)\n\
        With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you\n\
        really didn''t forget anything, try typing `2'' now; then\n\
        my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
