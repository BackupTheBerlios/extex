TTP.EOFinDef=File ended while scanning definition of {0}
TTP.EOFinDef.help=I suspect you have forgotten a `}'', causing me\n\
        to read past where you wanted me to stop.\n\
        I''ll try to recover; but if the error is serious,\n\
        you''d better type `E'' or `X'' now and fix your file.

TTP.TFMnotFound=Font {0}={1} not loadable: Metric (TFM) file not found
TTP.TFMnotFound.help=I wasn''t able to read the size data for this font,\n\
        so I will ignore the font specification.\n\
        [Wizards can fix TFM files using TFtoPL/PLtoTF.]\n\
        You might try inserting a different font spec;\n\
        e.g., type `I\\font<same font id/gt;=<substitute font name>''.
# TTP [561]
TTP.TFMisBad=Font {0}={1} not loadable: Bad metric (TFM) file

        so I will ignore the font specification.\n\
        [Wizards can fix TFM files using TFtoPL/PLtoTF.]\n\
        You might try inserting a different font spec;\n\

# TTP [1259]
TTP.ImproperAt=Improper `at'' size ({0}pt), replaced by 10pt

        less than 2048pt, so I''ve changed what you said to 10pt.
