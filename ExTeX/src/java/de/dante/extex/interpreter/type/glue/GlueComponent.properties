TTP.IllegalUnit=Illegal unit of measure (pt inserted)
TTP.IllegalUnit.help=Dimensions can be in units of em, ex, in, pt, pc,\n\
        cm, mm, dd, cc, bp, or sp; but yours is a new one!\n\
        I''ll assume that you meant to say pt, for printer''s points.\n\
        To recover gracefully from this error, it''s best to\n\
        delete the erroneous units; e.g., type `2'' to delete\n\
        two letters. (See Chapter 27 of The TeXbook.)
