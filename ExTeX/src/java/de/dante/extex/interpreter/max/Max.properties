# TTP [82]
TTP.ErrorLimitReached=(That makes {0} errors; please try again.)
# TTP [370]
TTP.UndefinedToken=Undefined control sequence
TTP.UndefinedToken.help=The control sequence at the end of the top line\n\
        of your error message was never \\def''ed. If you have\n\
        misspelled it (e.g., `\\hobx''), type `I'' and the correct\n\
        spelling (e.g., `I\\hbox''). Otherwise just continue,\n\
        and I''ll forget about whatever was undefined.
# TTP [403]
TTP.MissingLeftBrace=Missing '{' inserted
TTP.MissingLeftBrace.help=A left brace was mandatory here, so I''ve put one in.\n\
        You might want to delete and/or insert some corrections\n\
        so that I will find a matching right brace soon.\n\
        (If you''re confused by all this, try typing `I}'' now.)
# TTP [415,446]
TTP.MissingNumber=Missing number, treated as zero
TTP.MissingNumber.help=A number should have been here; I inserted `0''.\n\
        (If you can''t figure out why I needed to see a number,\n\
        look up `weird error'' in the index to The TeXbook.)
# TTP [434]
TTP.BadCharCode=Bad character code ({0})
TTP.BadCharCode.help=A character number must be between {1} and {2}.\n\
        I changed this one to zero.
# TTP [577]
TTP.MissingFontIdent=Missing font identifier
TTP.MissingFontIdent.help=I was looking for a control sequence whose\n\
        current meaning has been defined by \\font.
# TTP [1047]
TTP.MissingDollar=Missing $ inserted
TTP.MissingDollar.help=I''ve inserted a begin-math/end-math symbol since I think\n\
        you left one out. Proceed, with fingers crossed.
# TTP [1050]
TTP.CantUseIn=You can''t use `{0}'' in {1}
TTP.CantUseIn.help=Sorry, but I''m not programmed to handle this case;\n\
        I''ll just pretend that you didn''t ask for it.\n\
        If you''re in the wrong mode, you might be able to\n\
        return to the right one by typing `I}'' or `I$'' or `I\\par''.
# TTP [1084]
TTP.BoxExpected=A <box> was supposed to be here
TTP.BoxExpected.help=I was expecting to see \\hbox or \\vbox or \\copy or \\box or\n\
        something like that. So you might find something missing in\n\
        your output. But keep trying; you can fix this later.
# TTP [1215]
TTP.MissingCtrlSeq=Missing control sequence inserted
TTP.MissingCtrlSeq.help=Please don''t say `\\def cs{...}'', say `\\def\\cs{...}''.\n\
        I''ve inserted an inaccessible control sequence so that your\n\
        definition will be completed without mixing me up too badly.\n\
        You can recover graciously from this error, if you''re\n\
        careful; see exercise 27.2 in The TeXbook.
