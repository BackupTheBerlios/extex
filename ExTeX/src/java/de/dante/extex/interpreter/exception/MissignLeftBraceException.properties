TTP.MissingLeftBrace=Missing `'{''' inserted
TTP.MissingLeftBrace.help=A left brace was mandatory here, so I''ve put one in.\n\
        You might want to delete and/or insert some corrections\n\
        so that I will find a matching right brace soon.\n\
        (If you''re confused by all this, try typing `I}'' now.)
