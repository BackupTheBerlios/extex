 <body>
  This package contains some support for internationalization (i18n). 
  This includes potential messages to the user as well as an error concept.

  <h2>Messages</h2>
  <p>
   All messages of ExTeX are provided by resource bundles. Thus it is
   possible to translate the messages without touching the source
   files and recompiling. The central role is played by the interface
   {@link de.dante.extex.framework.i18n.Localizer Localizer}. This
   interface provides means to format messages in various ways.
  </p>
  <p>
   Usually the properties file has the same name as the class using it
   or related to it. The classes managed by a factory may receive a
   localizer from the factory following this rule. Some of the
   exception classes require a localizer to be passed to them. Most
   exceptions handle the aquireing of a localizer themself. Those
   exceptions are always associated with a properties file containing
   the format specifiers and texts.
  </p>
  <p>
   The interface Localizer and the properties files take the place of
   the ancient TeX pool file. Since the properties are usually
   contained in the jar file and the references use symbolic names
   instead of indices the chance that something goes wrong are much
   smaller than for the original TeX approach.
  </p>

  <h2>Error Concept</h2>
  <p>
   In the context of ExTeX errors lead to exceptions to be thrown. The
   exception class {@link de.dante.extex.i18n.HelpingException HelpingException}
   is the base class for all exceptions for which some help might be present.
