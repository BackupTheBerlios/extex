  This package contains the backends of <logo>ExTeX</logo> which are
  responsible for writing the constructed pages to an appropriate
  file. For instance a PDF writer and a PostScript writer are located
  in a sub-package.

  <h3>Writing a DocumentWriter</h3>
  <p>
   To write a document writer you start to create a class which
   implements the interface {@link
   de.dante.extex.documentWriter.DocumentWriter DocumentWriter}. This
   interface describes the ability to receive some nodes for
   processing. This is usually not enough. In addition it is necessary
   to send the result to some destination. This is accomplished by the
   interfaces {@link
   de.dante.extex.documentWriter.SingleDocumentStream
   SingleDocumentStream} and {@link
   de.dante.extex.documentWriter.MultipleDocumentStream
   MultipleDocumentStream}.
  </p>
  <h4>Output Streams</h4>
  <p>
   The decoupling of the actual output stream and the writing of the
   document is necessary to relief the document writer from the task
   and concentrate the same routine for each document writer in one
   place. On the other side with this approach it is possible to
   transparently add some processing before or after the document
   writer. It would also be possible not only to direct the output to
   some file but send it to a display immediately.
  </p>
  <p>
   The interface {@link
   de.dante.extex.documentWriter.SingleDocumentStream
   SingleDocumentStream} is used by those document writers which send
   the output to a single destination. At startup the method
   setOutputStream() is invoked and the output stream is passed to the
   document writer. As an example consider a classical dvi document
   writer which tries to produce one output file.
  </p>
  <p>
   The interface {@link
   de.dante.extex.documentWriter.MultipleDocumentStream
   MultipleDocumentStream} is used by those document writers which
   send the output to several destinations. As an example consider an
   EPS writer which produces one file per page. Here the method
   setOutputStreamFactory() is invoked at startup and a factory is
   passed to the document writer which can be used to acquire the next
   output stream. In fact MultipleDocumentStream can also be used in
   the case of a single output stream but the SingleDocumentStream is
   a little bit easier to use.
  </p>
  <h4>Localization</h4>
  <p>
   If the instantiated class implements the interface {@link
   de.dante.util.framework.i18n.Localizable Localizable} then the
   associated method is used to pass on the localizer to the new
   instance. The localizer is acquired from the {@link
   de.dante.util.framework.i18n.LocalizerFactory LocalizerFactory}
   with the name of the class as key.
  </p>
  <h4>Configuration</h4>
  <p>
   The document writer can implement the interface {@link
   de.dante.util.framework.configuration.Configurable Configurable}.
   In this case the configuration object is passed to the document
   writer at startup.
  </p>
  <p>
   The document writer can implement the interface {@link
   de.dante.util.resource.PropertyConfigurable PropertyConfigurable}.
   In this case the properties with the user's settings are passed to
   the document writer at startup.
  </p>
  <h4>Logging</h4>
  <p>
   The document writer can implement the interface {@link
   de.dante.util.framework.logger.LogEnabled LogEnabled}. In this case
   the logger is passed to the document writer at startup. It can be
   used to send some informative or debugging messages to the log
   file.
  </p>
  <h4>Color</h4>
  <p>
   The document writer can implement the interface {@link
   de.dante.extex.color.ColorAware ColorAware}. In this case a color
   converter is passed to the document writer.
  </p>
  <h4>Resource Access</h4>
  <p>
   The document writer can implement the interface {@link
   de.dante.util.resource.ResoureConsumer ResoureConsumer}. In this
   case a resource finder is passed to the document writer.
