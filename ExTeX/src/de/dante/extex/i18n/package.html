 <body>
  This package contains some support for internationalization (i18n). 
  This includes potential messages to the user as well as an error concept.

  <h2>Messages</h2>
  <p>
   All messages of ExTeX are provided by the class 
   {@link de.dante.extex.i18n.Messages Messages}. This class has a
   set of static methods to format a message. The messages are referred to by
   symbolic names. Those names are resolved in the properties file
   <i>config/extexMessage.properties</i> or one of its localized versions.
  </p>
  <p>
   The class Messages and the properties file take the place of the ancient
   TeX pool file. Since the properties are usually contained in the jar file
   and the references use symbolic names instead of indices the chance that
   something goes wrong are much smaller than for the original TeX approach.
  </p>

  <h2>Error Concept</h2>
  <p>
   In the context of ExTeX errors lead to exceptions to be thrown. The
   exception class {@link de.dante.extex.i18n.GeneralHelpingException GeneralHelpingException}
   is the base class for all exceptions for which some help might be present.
