  This package contains primitives for conditionals.

  <h1>Operation</h1>
  
  The macro expansion mechanism makes it rather simple to implement a
  conditional. At the beginning one has to decide whether or not this branch
  is active. In an if-then-else construction there are at most two branches,
  whereas in a switch there might be some more.
  <p>
  If the current branch is active then nothing has to be done except the
  storing of the information where the current conditional has started and its
  branch. The further expansion is just the same as it the conditional was not
  there.
  </p>
  <p>
  If the current branch is not active then we can enter a fast skip over the
  input tokens. Just those tokens are relevant which are related to
  conditionals. Opening conditionals and closing conditionals are counted
  until they balance. In a balanced state the branching macro (<tt>\else</tt>
  or <tt>\or</tt>) or the closing conditional is sought. All other tokens are
  simply discarted.
  </p>

  <h1>Implementation</h1>
  
  Conditionals are derived form the class AbstractIf. This class takes care of
  everything except the conmstruction of an object and the evaluation of the
  condition. Thus usually it is sufficient for the implementation of a new
  <tt>\if*</tt> to define the constructor and the method <tt>conditional()</tt>.
