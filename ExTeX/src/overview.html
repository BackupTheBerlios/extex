  <h3>Objectives</h3>

  The aim of ExTeX is the implementation of a typesetting system based
  on the ideas of TeX.

  <ul>
   <li> ExTeX should reproduce as good as possible the results of TeX:
    the visual appearance of a processed document in compatibility mode should
    be indistinguishable.
    <br />
    This does not mean that the produced files (dvi, pdf, aux, log, and
    others) are the identical to those produced by TeX.
   </li>
   <li> ExTeX should be configurable and extendable. Thus it can serve as a
    testbed for typesetting experiments. The default configuration reflects the
    evolving state of the art. 
    <br />
    A compatibility mode might be provided. But this has to be enabled
    actively.
   </li>
   <li> The implementation language is Java. Thus the features of this language
    will be used, e.g. the Unicode character set.
   </li>
  </ul>
