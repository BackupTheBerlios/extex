texdoc is a small utility program to convert the output of making TeX into
a set of HTML pages. In fact you get something like TeX--The Program in HTML.

Prerquisites:

- tex.tex as produced by tangling or weaving of TeX
- perl


Usage:

- invoke
        perl texdoc -v <location of tex.tex>

- or
        make TEXTEX=<location of tex.tex>

- or if you intend to do it more than once you can edit the Makefile and change
  the definition of TEXTTEX there and invoke
        make

Result:

You get a bunch of files named TeX_nnn.html. They contain the sections.
The entry point is TeX.html. Open this file in your favorite Browser.
